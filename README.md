This Repository contrains a few projects performed to grapple with the basics of deep learning

There are 4 projects:
1) MNSIT from scratch --  here I classified the MNSIT digits using a neural network I used form scratch with Numpy
2) MNSIT with pytorch -- MNSIT classification but then using Pytorch framework
3) CIFAR10 with Convnet -- classified the cifar images with a VGG inspiree convolutional neural network
4) LSTM_Alice_wonderland -- with an LSTM generated new sentences of alice in wonderlands
